Don't want to interrupt your workflow, uncollapsing the sidebar or switching sidebar tabs, just to see the newest roll/message send? Then this module is right for you!  
When the chat log tab is not active or collapsed, new messages will get shown as toast like notifications. The position. opacity, fade delay, max amount, .. is all customizable from the settings menu. (on a per user basis!)  
These notifications are interactable using left- and right-clicks, which results in the chat log being opened, the card being scrolled into view and the element you clicked on being clicked on!

# Important Information!
## FVTT Version compatibility
My focus is the FVTTs stable branch. I will neither promise nor prioritise updates for FVTTs beta or alpha branches! Feel free to report a bug so i know whats coming, but don't expect a fix before a stable FVTT update.

## FAQ

### Why was my click on a button on the notification unrecognized?

When another application is above the real (not the notification) chat cards button that you clicked, it sometimes prevents the click, sadly. I'm still searching for a workaround here, but for the time being it is like this.

## Bug Reporting and Feature Suggestions
Go to the [GitHub's issue board](https://github.com/Moerill/fvtt-chat-notifications/issues) and create an issue with the template fitting to what you want to post and follow its instructions.

**I will ignore half-hearted bug reports ignoring the issue template or Discord mentions!**  
Its not difficult to put at least some effort into something that you want someone else to put their spare time into to fix!
